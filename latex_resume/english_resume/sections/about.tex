I have worked as a Manual QA Engineer for 3 years.
Of these, for 2 years, in addition to manual testing,
I was engaged in automating games and routine work tasks using Python.
I discovered a passion for programming through this experience.
I strive to constantly improve my technical skills, to solve problems more effectively.
