I have been programming since 2019. My interest in Python came from a desire to automate the process of collecting and processing Russian market stock multiples, as well as the process of getting a signal to enter a trade in oil futures. These endeavors grew into my pet project.

For the last three years I have been working as a QA Engineer at Playrix, starting at junior level and reaching middle+. One of my main areas of responsibility was automating gameplay testing, where my knowledge of Python came in handy.
\\
As a result, I improved my skills not only in Python, but also in code review and refactoring, working with git in a team, and gained a little experience in mentoring.

At the moment I am actively learning FastAPI and am always ready for new challenges and tasks.
